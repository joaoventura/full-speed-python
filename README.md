Pdf and epub files can be downloaded from: https://github.com/joaoventura/full-speed-python/releases/

This book aims to teach the basics of the python programming language using a practical approach. The methods used in this book are basic, the reader is introduced to the topic (i.e. classes, objects, functions) then is presented with an exercise that implements the knowledge learned in the readings.

This books proposed method of basic problem solving is used in Web Development and Distributed Computing classes at the Superior School of Technology of Set√∫bal. Majority of students are effecient in Python in less than a month. In fact, students of the Distributed Computing course, taught in the second year of the software engineering degree, become familiar with Python's syntax in two weeks. The students were also able to implement a distributed client-server application with sockets by the third week of classes.

This book is made available in github (https://github.com/joaoventura/full-speed-python).  I welcome any pull requests to correct misspellings, to suggest new exercises or clarification of the current content.
